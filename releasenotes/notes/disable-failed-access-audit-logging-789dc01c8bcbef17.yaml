fixes:
  - Failed access logging is now disabled by default and can be enabled by
    changing ``auditd_rules['failed_access']`` to ``yes``. The rsyslog daemon
    checks for the existence of log files regularly and this audit rule was
    triggered very frequently, which led to very large audit logs.
