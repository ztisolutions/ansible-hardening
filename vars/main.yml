## Variables
# The variable files in the 'vars' directory are intended to hold variables
# that deployers should not override. These variables are used internally by
# the role to create templates, execute commands, or adjust configurations.
#
# There are three main variable files:
#
#   common.yml: variables that apply to all distributions
#   redhat.yml: variables that apply only to CentOS 7 and Red Hat Enterprise
#               Linux 7
#   ubuntu.yml: variables that apply only to Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) and
#               Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial)
#
# All variables that enable or disable functionality, or variables that a
# deployer might want to override should be placed in 'defaults/main.yml'.
