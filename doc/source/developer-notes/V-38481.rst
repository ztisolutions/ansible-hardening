**Exception**

Operating system patching policies vary from organization to organization and
are typically established based on business requirements and risk tolerance.

If desired, automatic updates (using the ``unattended-upgrades`` package)
can be enabled via openstack-ansible-security by setting the following
variable to ``true``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    unattended_upgrades: true

Note that this will only apply updates made available to the distro-security
(eg. trusty-security) repositories.

**Deployers are urged to fully understand the impact of enabling automatic
update before making the change.**
