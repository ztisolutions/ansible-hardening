The STIG requires that daemons have their umask set to ``027`` or ``022``.
Since changing umasks can disrupt some systems, this is an opt-in change.

Deployers that want this change applied to their systems must set the Ansible
variable ``security_umask_daemons_init`` to ``027``. The current default for
Ubuntu 14.04 is ``027`` already, so deployers do not need to make any
adjustments to Ansible variables to meet the STIG requirement.
