Ubuntu's default for ``security_disk_error_action`` is ``SUSPEND``, which
actually only suspends audit logging. That could be a security issue, so
``SYSLOG`` is recommended and is set by default by openstack-ansible-security.
There are additional options available, like ``EXEC``, ``SINGLE`` or ``HALT``.

To configure a different ``security_disk_error_action``, set the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disk_error_action: SYSLOG

For details on available settings and what they do, run ``man auditd.conf``.
Some options can cause the host to go offline until the issue is fixed.
Deployers are urged to **carefully read the auditd documentation** prior to
changing the ``security_disk_error_action`` setting from the default.
