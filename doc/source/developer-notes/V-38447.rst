**Exception**

Verifying contents of files installed from packages is more difficult in
Ubuntu, mainly due to the lack of an equivalent of ``rpm -V``. The ``debsums``
package installs the ``debsums`` command and that can be used to look for
files that have changed since the package was installed.

However, not all packages have MD5 checksums for all files and ``debsums``
doesn't do detailed checking like ``rpm``.  Deployers are urged to run
``debsums -c`` to review changes made to files on their systems. This report
takes a long time to run on most systems.
