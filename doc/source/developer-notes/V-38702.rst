Although neither Ubuntu nor openstack-ansible installs or configures
``vsftpd`` by default, the Ansible task will ensure that the appropriate
log configuration lines are applied to ``/etc/vsftpd.conf`` to meet the
STIG requirements. If the ``vsftpd`` package isn't installed, the Ansible
tasks won't make any changes to the system.
