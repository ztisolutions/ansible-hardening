**Exception**

The audit rules for logging failed accesses can generate significant amounts of
log traffic in some environments. These rules are disabled by default.

To opt-in for this change and enable audit logging for these events, adjust
the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    auditd_rules['failed_access']: yes
