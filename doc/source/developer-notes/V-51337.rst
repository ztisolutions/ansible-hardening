Ubuntu loads the AppArmor module by default starting with version 8.04. For
more information, review the `AppArmor documentation`_ on Ubuntu's site.
In addition, the openstack-ansible project configures AppArmor policies
for the LXC containers which run the OpenStack infrastructure.

The tasks for this STIG will verify that AppArmor is enabled via the
``apparmor_status``. The playbook will fail if AppArmor is found to be
disabled on the host.
