Ubuntu sets the mode on rsyslog files to ``0640`` by default, but the STIG
requires ``0600`` or less. The Ansible tasks will adjust the rsyslog
configuration so that any new log files will have the mode set to ``0600``.

This will take effect the next time that log files are rotated with
``logrotate`` (configured in V-38624).
