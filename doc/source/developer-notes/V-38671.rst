Although neither Ubuntu nor openstack-ansible install or configure sendmail
by default, the Ansible task will remove the sendmail package if it exists on
the system.

To opt-out of this change, adjust the following Ansible variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remove_services['sendmail']: no
