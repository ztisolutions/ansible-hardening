**Fixed by another STIG**

The ``rexecd`` daemon is part of the package that contains the ``rsh`` daemon.

Neither Ubuntu or openstack-ansible installs the rsh daemon by default.
Running a rsh daemon isn't recommended under most situations, so the
rsh server package will be removed from the system if it is installed.

The rsh server is removed by the Ansible tasks for V-38591, so no action
is required here.
