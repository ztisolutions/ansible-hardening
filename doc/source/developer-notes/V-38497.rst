Ubuntu 14.04 allows accounts with null passwords to authenticate via PAM by
default. This STIG requires that those login attempts are blocked.

In Ubuntu, this functionality is controlled by the ``nullok_secure`` parameter
found in ``/etc/pam.d/common-auth``.  The Ansible task for this STIG will
remove the ``nullok_secure`` from the PAM configuration file.  The effects of
the change are immediate and no service restarts are required.

However, deployers can opt-out of this change by adjusting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_pam_remove_nullok: no

Setting the variable to ``yes`` (the default) will cause the Ansible tasks to
remove the ``nullok_secure`` parameter while setting the variable to ``no``
will leave the PAM configuration unchanged.
