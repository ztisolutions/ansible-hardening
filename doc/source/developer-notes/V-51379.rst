**Exception**

Although SELinux works through a labeling system where every file (including
devices) receive a label, AppArmor works purely through policies without
labels. However, openstack-ansible does configure several AppArmor policies
to reduce the chances and impact of LXC container breakouts on OpenStack
hosts.
