The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) must be disabled. This module
isn't used by Ubuntu 14.04 or openstack-ansible by default.

To opt-out of this change, set the following variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_module_sctp: no

**NOTE:** The module will be disabled on the next reboot.
