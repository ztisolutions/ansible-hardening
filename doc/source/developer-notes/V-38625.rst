**Exception**

Neither Ubuntu 14.04 or openstack-ansible configures LDAP authentication by
default. Deployers that use LDAP authentication for systems are strongly
urged to use TLS connectivity between client hosts and LDAP servers to
prevent eavesdroppers on the network from reading the authentication attempts
as they are made. The certificates on the LDAP server must be trusted by
each client.
