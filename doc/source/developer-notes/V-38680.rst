By default, Ubuntu sets the default recipient for storage capacity issues in
auditd to the root user. The Ansible task ensures that the default remains set.

Deployers are strongly urged to review V-38446 to ensure they have set the
``root_forward_email`` variable so that the email system can route these
critical notifications to a monitored mailbox.
