**Exception**

As with V-38585, this is left to the deployer to configure bassed on their
exposure to physical threats.  If there is a concern around a user gaining
unauthorized physical access and/or gaining access through an out-of-band
access mechanism, deployers are strongly urged to consider applying this
security configuration.
