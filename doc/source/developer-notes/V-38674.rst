Ubuntu 14.04 sets the default runlevel in ``/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf`` and it
should be set to ``2`` on Ubuntu systems. The Ansible task will verify that the
correct runlevel is set.

For operating systems that use systemd, such as Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7, the
Ansible tasks will verify that the ``graphical.target`` is not loaded by
default.

If any of these verifications fails, an error will be printed and the playbook
will fail.
