Although neither Ubuntu 14.04 or openstack-ansible installs the ``bluetooth``
package, the Ansible tasks will disable the service and stop it if it's found
to be running on the system.

To opt-out of this change, adjust the following Ansible variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    disable_services['bluetooth']: no
