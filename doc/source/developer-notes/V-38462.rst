Ubuntu checks packages against GPG signatures by default.  It can be turned
off for all package installations by a setting in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ and we
search for that in the Ansible task.  A warning is printed if the
``AllowUnauthenticated`` configuration option is present in the apt
configuration directories.

Please note that users can pass an argument on the apt command line
to bypass the checks as well, but that's outside the scope of this check
and remediation.
