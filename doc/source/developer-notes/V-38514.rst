The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) must be disabled if it's not
needed. Neither Ubuntu 14.04 or openstack-ansible utilizes this kernel
module and the Ansible tasks will disable it by default.

To opt-out of this change, simply change the following variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_module_dccp: no

**NOTE:** The module will be disabled on the next reboot.
