**Opt-in required**

Neither Ubuntu or openstack-ansible installs the csh shell by default.

Since umask changes can be disruptive on some systems, the deployer must
opt-in for this change to happen. If the ``umask_csh`` Ansible variable is
set **and** the csh package is installed, the Ansible tasks will ensure the
appropriate umask is set in the csh configuration file.

If users have an active csh shell session, they will need to logout and create
a new session to pick up the new umask change.
