**Exception**

Installing an antivirus program on openstack-ansible infrastructure is left
up to the deployer. There are strong arguments against virus scanners due to
detection failures and performance impacts.

For deployers who require an antivirus solution, refer to the suggestions and
examples in `Ubuntu's documentation on antivirus software`_.
