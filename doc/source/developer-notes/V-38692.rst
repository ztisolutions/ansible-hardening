**Opt-in required**

By default, Ubuntu doesn't require that inactive accounts are locked after a
period of time. The STIG requires that accounts with 35 days of activity are
locked.

Deployers must opt-in for this change by setting the
``security_inactive_account_lock_days`` Ansible variable. The STIG requires
this to be set to 35 days at a maximum. The Ansible tasks will not make any
changes to ``/etc/default/useradd`` unless
``security_inactive_account_lock_days`` is set.
