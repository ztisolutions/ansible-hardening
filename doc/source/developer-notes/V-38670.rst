The AIDE package is already installed as part of the Ansible tasks to fix
V-38429, but these Ansible tasks will verify that the cron job file is actually
in place. Ubuntu will configure the cron job automatically as soon as the
package is installed. If the cron job is missing, an error will be printed
and the playbook will fail.
