**Exception**

Ubuntu's default umask setting in ``/etc/login.defs`` is ``022``, but the STIG
requires ``077`` to be set. Since changing umask settings can disrupt some
systems, this change requires a deployer to opt-in.

To opt-in for this change and adjust the umask, the Ansible variable
``security_umask_login_defs`` must be set to ``077``.
