**Special case**

Ubuntu doesn't provide the same ``ntpdate`` service that a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 server would have. In addition, time synchronization is added within
the fixes for V-38620 (where ``chrony`` is installed and configured).

There is no action to be taken on Ubuntu for this STIG.
