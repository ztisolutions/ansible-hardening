V-38437: Automated file system mounting tools must not be enabled unless needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the system
should be explicitly listed in "/etc/fstab" by an administrator. New
filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.  The
"autofs" daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home directories
shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle removable
media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as "/misc/cd".
However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so
autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is
required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts
statically by editing "/etc/fstab" rather than relying on the automounter.
