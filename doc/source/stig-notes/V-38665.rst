V-38665: The system package management tool must verify group-ownership on all files and directories associated with the audit package.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group-ownership of audit binaries and configuration files that is incorrect
could allow an unauthorized user to gain privileges that they should not have.
The group-ownership set by the vendor should be maintained. Any deviations
from this baseline should be investigated.
