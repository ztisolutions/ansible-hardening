V-38502: The /etc/shadow file must be owned by root.
----------------------------------------------------

The "/etc/shadow" file contains the list of local system accounts and stores
password hashes. Protection of this file is critical for system security.
Failure to give ownership of this file to root provides the designated owner
with access to sensitive information which could weaken the system security
posture.
