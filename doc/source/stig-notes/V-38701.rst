V-38701: The TFTP daemon must operate in secure mode which provides access only to a single directory on the host file system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the "-s" option causes the TFTP service to only serve files from the
given directory. Serving files from an intentionally specified directory
reduces the risk of sharing files which should remain private.
