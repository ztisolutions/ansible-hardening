V-38685: Temporary accounts must be provisioned with an expiration date.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When temporary accounts are created, there is a risk they may remain in place
and active after the need for them no longer exists. Account expiration
greatly reduces the risk of accounts being misused or hijacked.
