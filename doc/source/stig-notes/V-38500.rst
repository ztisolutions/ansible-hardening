V-38500: The root account must be the only account having a UID of 0.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts with a
UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password
for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is recommended to
afford multiple system administrators access to root privileges in an
accountable manner.
