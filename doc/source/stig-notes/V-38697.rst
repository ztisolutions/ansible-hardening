V-38697: The sticky bit must be set on all public directories.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users
to delete files in the directory structure.   The only authorized public
directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, or those
designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved
for directories used by the system, and by users for temporary file storage -
such as /tmp - and for directories requiring global read/write access.
