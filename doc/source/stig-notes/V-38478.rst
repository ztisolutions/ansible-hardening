V-38478: The Red Hat Network Service (rhnsd) service must not be running, unless using RHN or an RHN Satellite.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although systems management and patching is extremely important to system
security, management by a system outside the enterprise enclave is not
desirable for some environments. However, if the system is being managed by
RHN or RHN Satellite Server the "rhnsd" daemon can remain on.
