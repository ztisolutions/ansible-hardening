V-38686: The systems local firewall must implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for forwarded packets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In "iptables" the default policy is applied only after all the applicable
rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the default policy to
"DROP" implements proper design for a firewall, i.e., any packets which are
not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.
