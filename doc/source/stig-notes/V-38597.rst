V-38597: The system must limit the ability of processes to have simultaneous write and execute access to memory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as a
limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be executed,
on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory regions such
as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware prevents
execution in that address range.
