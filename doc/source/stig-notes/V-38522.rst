V-38522: The audit system must be configured to audit all attempts to alter system time through settimeofday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arbitrary changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate nefarious
activities in log files, as well as to confuse network services that are
highly dependent upon an accurate system time (such as sshd). All changes to
the system time should be audited.
