V-38668: The x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence must be disabled.
---------------------------------------------------------------

A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can
reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of
mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of
availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical
environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is
reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.
