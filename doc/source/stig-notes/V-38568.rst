V-38568: The audit system must be configured to audit successful file system mounts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

information leak where classified information, Privacy Act information, and
intellectual property could be lost. An audit trail should be created each
time a filesystem is mounted to help identify and guard against information
loss.
