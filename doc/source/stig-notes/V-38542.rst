V-38542: The system must use a reverse-path filter for IPv4 network traffic when possible on all interfaces.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enabling reverse path filtering drops packets with source addresses that
should not have been able to be received on the interface they were received
on. It should not be used on systems which are routers for complicated
networks, but is helpful for end hosts and routers serving small networks.
