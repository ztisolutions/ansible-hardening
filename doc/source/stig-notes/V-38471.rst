V-38471: The system must forward audit records to the syslog service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The auditd service does not include the ability to send audit records to a
centralized server for management directly.  It does, however, include an
audit event multiplexor plugin (audispd) to pass audit records to the local
syslog server.
