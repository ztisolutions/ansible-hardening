V-38575: The audit system must be configured to audit user deletions of files and programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auditing file deletions will create an audit trail for files that are removed
from the system. The audit trail could aid in system troubleshooting, as well
as detecting malicious processes that attempt to delete log files to conceal
their presence.
