V-38582: The xinetd service must be disabled if no network services utilizing it are enabled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The xinetd service provides a dedicated listener service for some programs,
which is no longer necessary for commonly-used network services. Disabling it
ensures that these uncommon services are not running, and also prevents
attacks against xinetd itself.
