V-38634: The system must rotate audit log files that reach the maximum file size.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Automatically rotating logs (by setting this to "rotate") minimizes the
chances of the system unexpectedly running out of disk space by being
overwhelmed with log data. However, for systems that must never discard log
data, or which use external processes to transfer it and reclaim space,
"keep_logs" can be employed.
