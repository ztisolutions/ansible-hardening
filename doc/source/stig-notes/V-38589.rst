V-38589: The telnet daemon must not be running.
-----------------------------------------------

The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which means that
data from the login session, including passwords and all other information
transmitted during the session, can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network.
The telnet protocol is also subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.  Mitigation:
If an enabled telnet daemon is configured to only allow encrypted sessions,
such as with Kerberos or the use of encrypted network tunnels, the risk of
exposing sensitive information is mitigated.
