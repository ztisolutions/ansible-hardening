V-38479: User passwords must be changed at least every 60 days.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to periodically
change their passwords. This could possibly decrease the utility of a stolen
password. Requiring shorter password lifetimes increases the risk of users
writing down the password in a convenient location subject to physical
compromise.
