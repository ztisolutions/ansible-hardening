------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding their account.
Providing users with information regarding the number of unsuccessful attempts
that were made to login to their account allows the user to determine if any
unauthorized activity has occurred and gives them an opportunity to notify
administrators.
