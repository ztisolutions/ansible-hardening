V-38587: The telnet-server package must not be installed.
---------------------------------------------------------

Removing the "telnet-server" package decreases the risk of the unencrypted
telnet service's accidental (or intentional) activation.  Mitigation:  If the
telnet-server package is configured to only allow encrypted sessions, such as
with Kerberos or the use of encrypted network tunnels, the risk of exposing
sensitive information is mitigated.
