V-38620: The system clock must be synchronized continuously, or at least daily.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enabling the "ntpd" service ensures that the "ntpd" service will be running
and that the system will synchronize its time to any servers specified. This
is important whether the system is configured to be a client (and synchronize
only its own clock) or it is also acting as an NTP server to other systems.
Synchronizing time is essential for authentication services such as Kerberos,
but it is also important for maintaining accurate logs and auditing possible
security breaches.
