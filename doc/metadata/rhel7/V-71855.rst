Ansible tasks will check the ``rpm -Va`` output (on CentOS and RHEL) or the
output of ``debsums`` (on Ubuntu) to see if any files installed from packages
have been altered. The tasks will print a list of files that have changed
since their package was installed.

Deployers should be most concerned with any checksum failures for binaries and
their libraries. These are most often a sign of system compromise or poor
system administration practices.

Configuration files may appear in the list as well, but these are often less
concerning since some of these files are adjusted by the security role itself.
