On Ubuntu systems, the tasks comment out the ``no-debsig`` configuration line
in ``/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg``.  This causes ``dpkg`` to verify GPG signatures for
all packages that are installed locally.

On CentOS 7 systems, the tasks set the ``localpkg_gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in
the ``/etc/yum.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all packages installed
locally with ``yum``.

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_gpgcheck: no

Note that setting this variable also affects two other STIG configurations:

* :ref:`stig-RHEL-07-020150`
* :ref:`stig-RHEL-07-020152`
