The tasks in the security role examine the world-writable directories on the
system and report any directories that are not group-owned by the ``root``
user. Those directories appear in the Ansible output.

Deployers should review the list of directories and group owners to ensure
that they are appropriate for the directory. Unauthorized group ownership
could allow certain users to modify files from other users.
