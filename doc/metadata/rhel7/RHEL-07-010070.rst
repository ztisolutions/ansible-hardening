The session inactivity timeout is set to 900 seconds to meet the STIG
requirements. After this time, users must re-enter their credentials to regain
access to the system.

Deployers can adjust this timeout by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_lock_session_inactive_delay: 900
