The ``offline_credentials_expiration`` configuration is set to ``1`` in
``/etc/sssd/sssd.conf``, which causes credentials to expire after one day.
Deployers can adjust this expiration time by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_pam_offline_credentials_expiration_days: 1
