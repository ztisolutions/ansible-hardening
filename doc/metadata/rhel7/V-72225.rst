The tasks in the security role deploy a standard notice and consent banner into
``/etc/motd`` on each server. Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
display this banner after each successful login via ssh or the console.

Deployers can choose a different destination for the banner by setting the
following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_banner_file: /etc/motd

The text of the banner file is configurable by editing
``files/login_banner.txt`` in the security role.
