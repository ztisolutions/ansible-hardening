The umask for authenticated users is set to ``077`` by the tasks in the
security role. This is the default for Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux already.

Deployers can choose a different umask value by setting the following Ansible
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_shadow_utils_umask: 077
