Setting a limit on the lifetime for passwords might be disruptive for some
users without proper communication explaining the change. Therefore, this
change is **disabled by default**.

Deployers can opt in for this change and provide a maximum lifetime for user
passwords (in days) by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_password_max_lifetime_days: 60
