The ``firewalld`` service is optionally enabled and configured in the tasks for
another STIG control:

* :ref:`stig-RHEL-07-040290`

Deployers should review their ``firewalld`` ruleset regularly to ensure that
each firewall rule is specific as possible. Each rule should allow the smallest
number of hosts to access the smallest number of services.
