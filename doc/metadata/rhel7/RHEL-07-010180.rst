The default password storage mechanism for Ubuntu 16.04, CentOS 7, and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 is ``SHA512`` and the tasks in the security role ensure that
the default is maintained.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_require_sha512_password_storage: no
