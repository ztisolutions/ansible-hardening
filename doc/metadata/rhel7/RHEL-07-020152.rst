On Ubuntu systems, the tasks check for the ``AllowUnauthenticated`` string
anywhere in the apt configuration files found within ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/``.
If the string is found, a warning is printed on the console.

On CentOS 7 systems, the tasks set the ``repo_gpgcheck`` option to ``1`` in the
``/etc/yum.conf`` file. This enables GPG checks for all repository metadata.

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_enable_gpgcheck: no

Note that setting this variable also affects two other STIG configurations:

* :ref:`stig-RHEL-07-020150`
* :ref:`stig-RHEL-07-020151`
