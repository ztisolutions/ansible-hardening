The tasks add a rule to auditd that logs each time the ``pt_chown`` command
is used.

Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_rhel7_audit_pt_chown: no

.. note::

    No action is taken on Ubuntu 16.04 because ``pt_chown`` is not available.
