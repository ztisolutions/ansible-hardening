This control applies only to systems that run PKI services, such as the
`FreeIPA <https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page>`_ project or the
`Red Hat Identity Management <https://access.redhat.com/products/identity-management>`_
product. Deployers should carefully review the requirements for this control
before making any changes.

.. warning::

    Changing revocation settings might cause certain systems or users to lose
    access to critical servers. Always test these configuration changes in a
    non-production environment first.
