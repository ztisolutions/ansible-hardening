Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux already capture the logs from cron.

Ubuntu systems collect cron job logs into the main syslog file
(``/var/log/syslog``) rather than separate them into their own log file.
CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems collect cron logs in
``/var/log/cron``.

Deployers should not need to adjust these configurations unless a specific
environment requires it. The tasks in the security role do not make changes to
the ``rsyslog`` configuration.
