The tasks in the security role examine the ``/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf``
file (if it exists) to ensure that ``ocsp_on`` is included in all three
``cert_policy`` directives. If ``oscp_on`` is not found three times in the
file, a message is printed in the Ansible output.

This change is only needed on systems which use PKI-based authentication (using
certificates).
