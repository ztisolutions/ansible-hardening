The tasks in the Ansible role install the ``dracut-fips`` and
``dracut-fips-aesni`` packages and check to see if FIPS is enabled on the
system. If it is not enabled, a warning message is printed in the Ansible
output.

Enabling FIPS at boot time requires additional manual configuration. Refer to
`Chapter 7. Federal Standards and Regulations`_ in the Red Hat documentation
for more details. Section 7.1.1 contains the steps required for updating
the bootloader configuration and regenerating the initramfs.

.. note::

    This change only applies to CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Ubuntu
    does not use dracut by default and the process for enabling the FIPS
    functionality at boot time is more complex.
