The ``MACs`` configuration is set to ``hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512`` in
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and sshd is restarted.

Deployers can adjust the allowed Message Authentication Codes (MACs) by setting
the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_sshd_allowed_macs: 'hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512'
