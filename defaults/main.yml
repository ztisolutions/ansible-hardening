### Default configurations for openstack-ansible-security #####################
#
# All of the configuration items below are documented in the developer notes
# found here:
#
#    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/
#
###############################################################################

## AIDE
# The default Ubuntu configuration for AIDE will cause it to wander into some
# terrible places on the system, such as /var/lib/lxc and images in /opt.
# The following three default exclusions are highly recommended for AIDE to
# work properly, but additional exclusions can be added to this list if needed.
aide_exclude_dirs:
  - /var/lib/lxc
  - /openstack
  - /opt
#
# By default, the AIDE database won't be initialized immediately since it can
# consume plenty of CPU and I/O resources while it runs. To initialize the
# AIDE database immediately when the playbook finishes, set the following
# variable to 'true':
initialize_aide: false

## Audit daemon
# The following booleans control the rule sets added to auditd's default
# set of auditing rules.  To see which rules will be added for each boolean,
# refer to the templates/osas-auditd.j2 file.
#
# If the template changes due to booleans being adjusted, the new template
# will be deployed onto the host and auditd will get the new rules loaded
# automatically with augenrules.
#

#
# **DANGER**
# Changing the options below can cause systems to go offline unexpectedly or
# stop serving requests as a security precaution. Read the developer notes for
# each STIG prior to adjusting the following variables.
# **DANGER**
#
# Set an action to occur when there is a disk error. Review the
# documentation for V-38464 before changing this option.
disk_error_action: SYSLOG                         # V-38464
#
# Set an action to occur when the disk is full. Review the documentation for
# V-38468 before changing this option.
disk_full_action: SYSLOG                          # V-38468
#
# V-38678 - Set the amount of megabytes left when the space_left_action
# triggers. The STIG guideline doesn't specify a size, but Ubuntu chooses a
# default of 75MB, which is reasonable.
space_left: 75                                    # V-38678
#
# Set an action to occur when the disk is approaching its capacity.
# Review the documentation for V-38470 before changing this option.
space_left_action: SYSLOG                         # V-38470
#
# Set the maximum size of a rotated log file. Ubuntu's default
# matches the STIG requirement of 6MB.
max_log_file: 6                                   # V 38633
#
# Sets the action to take when log files reach the maximum file size.
# Review the documentation for V-38634 before changing this option.
max_log_file_action: ROTATE                       # V-38634
#
# Set the number of rotated audit logs to keep.  Ubuntu has 5 as the default
# and this matches the STIG's requirements.
num_logs: 5                                       # V-38636
#
# Set the email address of someone who can receive and respond to notifications
# about low disk space for log volumes.
action_mail_acct: root                            # V-38680
#
# **IMMINENT DANGER**
# The STIG says that the system should switch to single user mode when the
# storage capacity gets very low. This can cause serious service disruptions
# and should only be set to 'single' for deployers in extremely high security
# environments. Ubuntu's default is SUSPEND, which will suspend logging.
# **IMMENENT DANGER**
admin_space_left_action: SUSPEND                  # V-54381

## Chrony (NTP) configuration
# Adjust the following NTP servers if necessary.
ntp_servers:
  - 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org
# Chrony limits access to clients that are on certain subnets.  Adjust the
# following subnets here to limit client access to chrony servers.
allowed_ntp_subnets:
  - 10/8
  - 192.168/16
  - 172.16/12

## Core dumps
# V-38675 requires disabling core dumps for all users unless absolutely
# necessary. Set this variable to 'no' to skip this change.
disable_core_dumps: yes                           # V-38675

## Services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services are running if no services
# utilizing it are enabled.  Setting a boolean to 'yes' here will ensure that
# a service isn't actively running and will not be started after boot-up.
# Setting a 'no' will ensure that this Ansible role does not alter the service
# in any way from its current configuration.
#
disable_services:
  abrtd: yes                                      # V-38641
  atd: yes                                        # V-38640

  bluetooth: yes                                  # V-38691
  qpidd: yes                                      # V-38648
  rsh: yes                                        # V-38594

  xinetd: yes                                     # V-38582
#
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services aren't installed at ANY time.
# Those services are listed here.  Setting a boolean here to 'yes' wiil
# ensure that the STIG is followed and the service is removed.  Setting a
# boolean to 'no' means that the playbook will not alter the service.
#
remove_services:
  ldap-server: yes                                # V-38627
  rsh-server: yes                                 # V-38591
  sendmail: yes                                   # V-38671

  xorg: yes                                       # v-38676
  ypserv: yes                                     # V-38603

## SSH configuration
# The following configuration items will adjust how the ssh daemon is
# configured.  The recommendations from the RHEL 6 STIG are shown below, but
# they can be adjusted to fit a particular environment.
#
# Set a 15 minute time out for SSH sessions if there is no activity
ssh_client_alive_interval: 900                    # V-38608
#
# Timeout ssh sessions as soon as ClientAliveInterval is reached once
ssh_client_alive_count_max: 0                     # V-38610
#
# The ssh daemon must not permit root logins. The default value of 'yes' is a
# deviation from the STIG requirements due to how openstack-ansible operates,
# especially within OpenStack CI gate jobs. See documentation for V-38613 for
# more details.
ssh_permit_root_login: 'yes'                      # V-38613

## Kernel
# Set these booleans to 'yes' to disable the kernel module (following the
# STIG requirements). Set the boolean to 'no' to ensure no changes are made.
disable_module:
  bluetooth: yes                                  # V-38682
  dccp: yes                                       # V-38514
  rds: yes                                        # V-38516
  sctp: yes                                       # V-38515
  tipc: yes                                       # V-38517
  usb_storage: no                                 # V-38490
#
# ** DANGER **
# It's strongly recommended to fully understand the effects of changing the
# following sysctl tunables. Refer to the documentation under 'Developer
# Notes' for each of the STIGs below before making any changes.
# ** DANGER **
#
sysctl_tunable:
  tcp_syncookies: 1                               # V-38539
#
# Deployers who wish to disable IPv6 entirely must set this configuration
# variable to 'yes'. See the documentation for V-38546 before making this
# change.
disable_ipv6: no                                  # V-38546

## Mail
# The STIG requires inet_interfaces to be set to 'localhost', but Ubuntu will
# configure it to be 'all' when dpkg-reconfigure is unavailable (as it is when
# Ansible installs packages). The default here is 'localhost' to meet the STIG
# requirement, but some deployers may want this set to 'all' if their hosts
# need to receive emails over the network (which isn't common).
#
# See the documentation for V-38622 for more details.
postfix_inet_interfaces: localhost                # V-38622
#
# Configuring an email address here will cause hosts to forward the root user's
# email to another address.
#
#root_forward_email: user@example.com

## PAM and authentication
# V-38497 requires that accounts with null passwords aren't allowed to
# authenticate via PAM. Ubuntu 14.04's default allows these logins -- see the
# documentation for V-38497 for more details. Set the variable below to 'yes'
# to remove 'nullok_secure' from the PAM configuration or set it to 'no' to
# leave the PAM configuration unaltered.
pam_remove_nullok: yes                            # V-38497
#
# V-38501 requires that failed login attempts must lock a user account using
# pam_faillock, but Ubuntu doesn't package that PAM module. Instead, fail2ban
# can be installed to lock out IP addresses with failed logins for 15 minutes.
# Set the variable below to 'yes' to install and configure fail2ban.
install_fail2ban: no                              # V-38501
#
# The STIG requires bans to last 15 minutes. Adjust the following variable
# to set the time an IP is banned by fail2ban (in seconds).
fail2ban_bantime: 900                             # V-38501

## Password complexity and aging
# V-38475 - There is no password length requirement by default in Ubuntu
# 14.04. To set a password length requirement, uncomment
# password_minimum_length below. The STIG recommendation is 14 characters.
#password_minimum_length: 14                      # V-38475
# V-38477 - There is no password change limitation set by default in Ubuntu.
# To set the minimum number of days between password changes, uncomment
# the password_minimum_days variable below.  The STIG recommendation is 1 day.
#password_minimum_days: 1                         # V-38477
# V-38479 - There is no age limit on password by default in Ubuntu. Uncomment
# line below to use the STIG recommendation of 60 days.
#password_maximum_days: 60                        # V-38479
# V-38480 - To warn users before their password expires, uncomment the line
# below and they will be warned 7 days prior (following the STIG).
#password_warn_age: 7                             # V-38480
# V-38684 - Setting the maximum number of simultaneous logins per user. The
# STIG sets a limit of 10.
#max_simultaneous_logins: 10                      # V-38684
# V-38692 - Lock accounts that are inactive for 35 days.
#inactive_account_lock_days: 35                   # V-38692

## sudo
# V-58901 requires that 'NOPASSWD' and '!authenticate' do not appear in any
# sudoers files since they could lead to a compromise. Set the following
# variables to 'yes' to comment out any lines found with these prohibited
# parameters or leave them set to 'no' (the default) to leave sudoers files
# unaltered. Deployers are urged to review the documentation for this STIG
# before making changes.
sudoers_remove_nopasswd: no                       # V-58901
sudoers_remove_authenticate: no                   # V-58901

## umask settings
# The STIG recommends changing various default umask settings for users and
# daemons via different methods. However, this could cause serious issues for
# production OpenStack environements which haven't been tested with these
# changes.
#
# The variables below are set to match the STIG requirements, but they are
# commented out to ensure they require deployers to opt-in for each change. To
# opt in for one of the changes below, simply uncomment the line and run the
# playbook. Deployers are strongly advised to review the documentation for
# these changes and review their systems to ensure these changes won't cause
# service disruptions.
#
# V-38642 - Set umask for daemons in init scripts to 027 or 022
#umask_daemons_init: 027                          # V-38642
#
# V-38645 - System default umask in /etc/login.defs must be 077
#umask_login_defs: 077                            # V-38645
#
# V-38649 - System default umask for csh must be 077
#umask_csh: 077                                   # V-38649
#
# V-38651 - System default umask for bash must be 077
#umask_bash: 077                                  # V-38651
