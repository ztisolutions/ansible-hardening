## Disabling services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services are running if no services
# utilizing it are enabled.  Setting a boolean to 'yes' here will ensure that
# a service isn't actively running and will not be started after boot-up.
# Setting a 'no' will ensure that this Ansible role does not alter the service
# in any way from its current configuration.

## Removing services
# The STIG recommends ensuring that some services aren't installed at any time.

# boolean to 'no' means that the playbook will not alter the service.

# If the template changes due to booleans being adjusted, the new template
# will be deployed onto the host and auditd will get the new rules loaded

## SSH configuration
# The following configuration items will adjust how the ssh daemon is
# configured.  The recommendations from the RHEL 6 STIG are shown below, but
# they can be adjusted to fit a particular environment.
#
# V-38608 - Set a 15 minute time out for SSH sessions if there is no activity
ssh_client_alive_interval: 900
# V-38610 - Timeout ssh sessions as soon as ClientAliveInterval is reached once
ssh_client_alive_count_max: 0
# V-38613 - The ssh daemon must not permit root logins
# Deviation from the STIG due to operational requirements in openstack-ansible.
# See documentation for V-38613 for more details.
ssh_permit_root_login: 'yes'

## Chrony configuration
# Adjust the following NTP servers if necessary.
ntp_servers:
  - 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org
  - 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org
# Chrony limits access to clients that are on certain subnets.  Adjust the
# following subnets here to limit client access to chrony servers.
allowed_ntp_subnets:
  - 10/8
  - 192.168/16
  - 172.16/12

## Mail configuration
# Configuring an email address here will cause hosts to forward the root user's
# email to another address.
#root_forward_email: user@example.com

## Auditd configuration
# **DANGER**
# Set an action to occur when there is a disk error. Review the
# documentation for V-38464 before changing this option.
# **DANGER**
disk_error_action: SYSLOG                         # V-38464
# **DANGER**
# Set an action to occur when the disk is full. Review the documentation for
# V-38468 before changing this option.
# **DANGER**
disk_full_action: SYSLOG                          # V-38468
# V-38678 - Set the amount of megabytes left when the space_left_action
# triggers. The STIG guideline doesn't specify a size, but Ubuntu chooses a
# default of 75MB, which is reasonable.
space_left: 75                                    # V-38678
# **DANGER**
# Set an action to occur when the disk is approaching its capacity.
# Review the documentation for V-38470 before changing this option.
# **DANGER**
space_left_action: SYSLOG                         # V-38470
# Set the maximum size of a rotated log file. Ubuntu's default
# matches the STIG requirement of 6MB.
max_log_file: 6                                   # V 38633
# **DANGER**
# Sets the action to take when log files reach the maximum file size.
# Review the documentation for V-38634 before changing this option.
# **DANGER**
max_log_file_action: ROTATE                       # V-38634
# Set the number of rotated audit logs to keep.  Ubuntu has 5 as the default
# and this matches the STIG's requirements.
num_logs: 5                                       # V-38636
# **IMMINENT DANGER**
# The STIG says that the system should switch to single user mode when the
# storage capacity gets very low. This can cause serious service disruptions
# and should only be set to 'single' for deployers in extremely high security
# environments. Ubuntu's default is SUSPEND, which will suspend logging.
# **IMMENENT DANGER**
admin_space_left_action: SUSPEND                  # V-54381

## Authentication
# V-38475 - There is no password length requirement by default in Ubuntu
# 14.04. To set a password length requirement, uncomment
# password_minimum_length below. The STIG recommendation is 14 characters.
#password_minimum_length: 14                      # V-38475
# V-38477 - There is no password change limitation set by default in Ubuntu.
# To set the minimum number of days between password changes, uncomment
# the password_minimum_days variable below.  The STIG recommendation is 1 day.
#password_minimum_days: 1                         # V-38477
# V-38479 - There is no age limit on password by default in Ubuntu. Uncomment
# line below to use the STIG recommendation of 60 days.
#password_maximum_days: 60                        # V-38479
# V-38480 - To warn users before their password expires, uncomment the line
# below and they will be warned 7 days prior (following the STIG).
#password_warn_age: 7                             # V-38480
# V-38684 - Setting the maximum number of simultaneous logins per user. The
# STIG sets a limit of 10.
#max_simultaneous_logins: 10                      # V-38684

## Kernel modules
# Set these booleans to 'yes' to disable the kernel module (following the
# STIG requirements). Set the boolean to 'no' to ensure no changes are made.
disable_module:
  bluetooth: yes                                  # V-38682
  dccp: yes                                       # V-38514
  rds: yes                                        # V-38516
  sctp: yes                                       # V-38515

  usb_storage: no                                 # V-38490

## sysctl tunables
# ** DANGER **
# It's strongly recommended to fully understand the effects of changing the
# following sysctl tunables. Refer to the documentation under 'Developer
# Notes' for each of the STIGs below before making any changes.
# ** DANGER **
#
sysctl_tunable:
  tcp_syncookies: 1                               # V-38539

## Postfix
# The STIG requires inet_interfaces to be set to 'localhost', but Ubuntu will
# configure it to be 'all' when dpkg-reconfigure is unavailable (as it is when
# Ansible installs packages). The default here is 'localhost' to meet the STIG
# requirement, but some deployers may want this set to 'all' if their hosts
# need to receive emails over the network (which isn't common).
#
# See the documentation for V-38622 for more details.
#
postfix_inet_interfaces: localhost                # V-38622

## Disabling IPv6
# Deployers who wish to disable IPv6 entirely must set this configuration
# variable to 'yes'. See the documentation for V-38546 before making this
# change.
disable_ipv6: no                                  # V-38546
