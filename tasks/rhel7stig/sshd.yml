# Adding additional sshd configuration options is usually easy, but if a
# configuration file ends with certain configurations, like a "Match" stanza,
# we need a blank line to separate those configurations from the ones that
# are added by the security role. For that reason, we check for the existence
# of a marker line here and add a marker line to the file if it doesn't exist.
